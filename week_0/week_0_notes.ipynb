    "- Algorithm = A set of steps or set of rules used to complete a specific task\n",
    "- Software code can often be broken down into 3 different programming structures:\n",
    "    * Sequences = series of actions performed in specific order until all have been completed (ordinally)\n",
    "    * Selections = ask a question or have criteria to decide what action to take next \n",
    "    * Loops = ask question over and over again until a specifc answer is reached or the no. of specified reptitions is exhausted\n",
    "#### Computer basics\n",
    "- Motherboard = hold computer resources like the cpu. Will have expansion slots for cards (like graphics cards) for upgrades.\n",
    "- CPU or central processing unit = the brain of the computer as it processes information and manipulates data and carries out commands. It tends to get hot so it is covered by a peice call a heat sink that draws away heat.\n",
    "- RAM = random access memory, serves as the short term memory resource that is used when performing calculations. Cannot store files as it is cleared when computer is turned off\n",
    "- Hard Drive = long term storage\n",
    "- GUI (\"goo-eey\")= graphical user interface\n",

    "    * http = hypertext transfer protocol\n",
    "    * https = hypertext transfer protocol secure\n",
    "- following the scheme is the domain name that begins with a sub-domain like \"www\". The right most portion(.'s) is the top-level domain that may signal what type of site it is (ex .gov) or country/region specification \n",
    "- following the domain name is a file path that leads to a specific page.\n",
    "- A url also may have a parameter string(think queries) that often begins with a \"?\" to provide the sever with information on what page to pull up\n",
    "- A url might also have an anchor that is signaled with a \"#\" that directs you to a specific part of the webpage\n"

    "## What is a computer (Chapter 1.1)\n",
    "### \tHardware architecture \n",
    "- Input/Output \n",
    "\t- Refers to input/output devices like a keyboard and a monitor which allow us to interact and use computers\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "\t- holds programs and data. There are two main types of memory:\n",
    "\t\t- Main Memory = the storage device that holds the software while it is being processed by the CPU the main example of this device is RAM or random access memory\n",
    "\t\t- Secondary Memory = devices that store software in a relatively permanent manner (ex. the most important second memory device in a typical computer system is the hard disk). In addition, a USB flash drive would also be considered a piece of \"second memory\"\n",
    "\t- FLOW: essentially information in a computer system typically originates from second memory or user input and then is brought into main memory when it is needed. Such as running a program, the program itself and the data it uses will be copied from secondary memory into main memory temporarily so it can be used by the CPU\n",
    "- Central Processing Unit\n",
    "\t- basic definition is: a device that executes the individual commands of a program\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of software\n",
    "- Operating System\n",
    "\t- Is the core software of a computer that one- provides a user interface that allows users to interace with the machine and secondly- manages computer resources such as the CPU and main memory. It determines when programs are allowed to run, where they are loaded into memory, and how hardware devices communicate. The OS is responsible for making computers easier to use and making sure they run efficiently\n",
    "- Applications\n",
    "\t- is a generic term for basically any software apart from the OS. Some examples may be word processors, web browsers, missile control systems, and games.\n",
    "- the user interface for modern OS systems and applications is known as a GUI or Graphical User Interface\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "- Two fundamental techniques are used to store and manage information:\n",
    "\t- Analog information -  which is a continuous wave of information or signal, in direct proportion to the source of the information. (ex. electronic signal used to represent the vibrations of a sound wave -  the signals voltage varies in direct proportion to the original sound wave. A stereo amplifier sends this kind of electronic signal to its speakers which vibrate and reproduce the sound).\n",
    "\t\t- Specifically, the term Analog is used because its signal is directly analogous to the information it represents\t\n",
    "\t\t- Analog is also less accurate generally since an electrical signal will degrade as it goes down the wire so it will skew the true information of a signal whereas a digital signal is either at 5+Volts for a positive(1) signal and -5Volts for a negative(0) signal which either if altered slightly still can be recorded as a pos or a negative(1 or 0)\n",
    "\t- Digital technology - breaks a wave of information into discrete pieces(binary) and represents those peices as numbers. Each number represents the voltage level of one specific instance of a sound recording. The amount of digital measurements made in a second is called the \"sampling rate\"\n",
    "\t\t- converting/breaking up a stream of analog information into digital format is the act of \"digitzing\"\n",
    "\t\t- the number of bits we use in any given situation determnins the number of unique items we can represent: A single bit has two possible values 0 and 1 - therefore it can represent two possible items or situations. Whereas if we have two bits we can represent 4 possible items since there are exactly 4 permutations of two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11. Therefore N bits can represent up to 2^N unique items \n",
    "\t\t(ex. 4b =16items)\n",
    "### Hardware (Chapter 1.2)\n",
    "- CPU \n",
    "\t- the CPU interacts with the main memory to perfom all fundamental processing in a computer. It interprets and executes instructions. The CPU is made out of three important components:\n",
    "\t\t- control unit = coordinates the transfer of data and instructions between main memory and the registers in the CPU. It also coordinates the executution of the circuitry in the arithmetic/logic unit to perform operations on data stored in particular registers\n",
    "\t\t- registers = provide a small amount of storage space on the cpu itself. In most CPU's there are specialized & general registers - one example of a specialized register is the instruction register that holds the current instruction being executed \n",
    "\t\t- arithmetic/logic unit performs calculations and makes decisions.\n",
    "\t- the CPU is constructed on a chip called a microprocessor, a device that is part of the main circuit board of the computer\n",
    "\t- Information in a computer travels along a network of wires called the \"bus\" between components\n",
    "- Input/Output Devices \n",
    "\t- and input device is anything that allows you to input/capture data into a system where and output device is any component that emits informtion to the user.\n",
    "- Main Memory and Secondary Memory\n",
    "\t- A KB is equivalent to 2^10 bytes == 1024, a MB is 2^20 == 1.048M bytes\n",
    "\t- Main Memory = the storage device that holds the software while it is being processed by the CPU the main example of this device is RAM or random access memory\n",
    "\t\t- main memory is made up of a series of small consecutive memory locations that each have a \"address\" represented by a unique number\n",
    "\t\t- main memory is usually volatile which means that the information stored on it will be lost if the computer loses access to power\n",
    "\t- Secondary Memory = devices that store software in a relatively permanent manner (ex. the most important second memory device in a typical computer system is the hard disk). In addition, a USB flash drive would also be considered a piece of \"second memory\"\n",
    "\t\t- secondary memory is non-volatile\n",
    "\t- FLOW: essentially information in a computer system typically originates from second memory or user input and then is brought into main memory when it is needed. Such as running a program, the program itself and the data it uses will be copied from secondary memory into main memory temporarily so it can be used by the CPU\n",
    "- Cache \n",
    "\t- is used by the CPU to reduce the average access time to instructions and data. It is a small, fast memory that stores the contents of the most frequently used main memory locations.\n",
    "### Networks and the Internet (Chapter 1.3)\n",
    "- Network structures\n",
    "\t- A Network: consists of two or more computers connected together so they can exchange information.\n",
    " - Connection types\n",
    "\t- Point-to-point conncetion is a wired connection between two or more closely located computers. Usually faces delays due to the computers sharing a line for information exchange. \n",
    "\t\t- One technique to avoid network delays is to divide large messages of information into packets\n",
    "\t- Local Area Network (LAN) is a network type designed to span short distances and connect a relatively small number of computers. They are easy to install/manage and are reliable.\n",
    "\t- Wide area Network (WAN) connects two or more LANs often across long distances and handles transfering messages from one WAN to the other.\n",
    " - Internet vs the Web\n",
    "\t- The internet is a network of networks that originally began as a single WAN- as demands rose so did the expectations and capacity for the network. It allows for the communication between computers across the world\n",
    "\t- The World Wide Web or WWW (web) - allows for easy exchange of information for humans. Its software provides a common user interface that allows users to access various types of infromation with the click of a mouse.\n",
    "- a Protocol is a ste of rules that governs how two things communicate.\n",
    "\t- the software that controls the movement of messages across the internet must conform to a set of protocols called TCP/IP or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.\n",
    "\t\t- the IP software defines how information is formatted and transferred from the source to the destination\n",
    "\t\t- the TCP software handles problems such as peices of informtion arriving out of their original order or information getting lost, which can happen if too much information converges at one location at the same time.\n",
    "- Universal Resource Identifiers (URLS)\n",
    "\t- URLS or uniform resource locators uniquely specifies documents and other information for a browser to obtain and display. It contains a protocol such as https and an internet address and lastly a resource of interest.\n"
