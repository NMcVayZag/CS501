    "#### Compsci Overview\n",
    "- Algorithm = A set of steps or set of rules used to complete a specific task\n",
    "- Software code can often be broken down into 3 different programming structures:\n",
    "    * Sequences = series of actions performed in specific order until all have been completed (ordinally)\n",
    "    * Selections = ask a question or have criteria to decide what action to take next \n",
    "    * Loops = ask question over and over again until a specifc answer is reached or the no. of specified reptitions is exhausted\n",
    "#### Computer basics\n",
    "- Motherboard = hold computer resources like the cpu. Will have expansion slots for cards (like graphics cards) for upgrades.\n",
    "- CPU or central processing unit = the brain of the computer as it processes information and manipulates data and carries out commands. It tends to get hot so it is covered by a peice call a heat sink that draws away heat.\n",
    "- RAM = random access memory, serves as the short term memory resource that is used when performing calculations. Cannot store files as it is cleared when computer is turned off\n",
    "- Hard Drive = long term storage\n",
    "- GUI (\"goo-eey\")= graphical user interface\n",
    "#### Internet basics\n",
    "- A URL begins with a \"scheme\" which tells what kind of address it is.\n",
    "    * file = file URI Scheme\n",
    "    * ftp = file transfer protocol\n",
    "    * http = hypertext transfer protocol\n",
    "    * https = hypertext transfer protocol secure\n",
    "- following the scheme is the domain name that begins with a sub-domain like \"www\". The right most portion(.'s) is the top-level domain that may signal what type of site it is (ex .gov) or country/region specification \n",
    "- following the domain name is a file path that leads to a specific page.\n",
    "- A url also may have a parameter string(think queries) that often begins with a \"?\" to provide the sever with information on what page to pull up\n",
    "- A url might also have an anchor that is signaled with a \"#\" that directs you to a specific part of the webpage\n"

    "- Octal number system is a base 8 system. Uses digits 0-7.\n",
