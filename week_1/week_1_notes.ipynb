    "# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Java and Problem Solving\n",
    "### The Java Programming Language (Ch 1.4)\n",
    "- A Java Program(created in 1991)\n",
    "\t- Java is a object oriented language where Objects are fundamental elements that make up a program.\n",
    "\t- the language is accompanied by the \"JAVA API\" or \"standard class library\" that provides pre-made tools that allow for the ability to do things like: create graphics, communicate over networks, interact with data bases, among many other features\n",
    "\t- All java programs are defined using class definitions\n",
    "\t- Method\n",
    "\t\t- also typically known as a function, is a group of programming statements that is named. All java applications have a main method that serves as the entry point and is where execution begins for the app.\n",
    "\t\t- another example of a method is println(), however it is predefined by the language/library\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comments\n",
    "\t- comments help explain code and generally denoted by \"//\" in Java\t(inline documentation). Or block comment:  /* some info */\n",
    "- Identifiers and Reserved Words\t\n",
    "\t- An Identifier are words we use in programming to represent something like a class or the name of an argument\n",
    "\t- Other Identifiers are used for predefined code from the standard library such as: String, System, out, & println\n",
    "\t- Reserved word are identifiers that have a special meaning in the programming language - which can not be used for any other purpose such as naming a class or variable. Examples include class, public, static, void.\n",
    "\t- Typically use title case for classes such as \"Cannon\"\n",
    "- White Space\n",
    "\t- consists of blanks, tabs, and newline characters - used to format and make programms more readable\n",
    "### Program Development (Ch 1.5)\n",
    "- Programming language levels (high vs low)0-=\n",
    "\t- Main Depth Categories of Programming languages\n",
    "\t\t- Machine Language:(lowest) code understable and executable by CPUs and is expressed as a series of binary digits (extremely difficult for humans to interpret)\n",
    "\t\t- Assembly Language:(low) replaces the binary digits with mnemonics which are short english like words that represent commands or data. Easier to interpret but not executable by CPUs and must be translated into machine language\n",
    "\t\t- high-level language:(high) expressed in english-like phrases. a single high-level lang. programming statement can accomplish the equivalent of hundreds of machine language instructions. examples include: Java, Ada, C++, python\n",
    "\t\t- 4th generation language: (highest) inluded a lot of automized capabilities such as generating reports or interacting with a database \n",
    "\n",
    "- Editors Compilers Interpreters (software tools)\n",
    "\t- Comilers\n",
    "\t\t- a program that translates code in one language to equivalent code in another language (source code -> target language). Java is compiled into java bytecode(low-level similar to machine code) which is then executed by the java interpretor or Java Virtual Machine(JVM) (the bytecode is not specific to CPU spec but is specific to JVM version)\n",
    "\t- Interpreter\n",
    "\t\t- similar to a compiler however it actually interweaves the translation and execution activities- it will take a statement and translate then execute and then moves onto the next statement\n",
    "- Development Environments\n",
    "\t- the set of tools used to create, test, and modify a program. Some environments are referred to as IDE's or Integrated Developement Environments because they integrate various tools into a software program and provide a convinient GUI. Some examples of these tools are: intellisense, a debugger, a compiler/interpreter, documentation generators, archiving tools, and tools to help the user visual their program structure \n",
    "- Syntax and Semantics\n",
    "\t- Syntax:\n",
    "\t\t- set of rules for each language that dictate exactly how the vocabulary elements of the language can be combined to form statements. (ex. an Identifier cannot begin with a digit)\n",
    "\t- Semantics:\n",
    "\t\t- in programming defines what will happen when a statement is executed. Programming languages are usually unambiguous, meaning the semantics of a program are well defined- statments usually have one true meaning.\n",
    "- Errors (3types)\n",
    "\t- compile-time error:\n",
    "\t\t- an error identified by the compiler - a executable version of the program will not be created\n",
    "\t- run-time error:\n",
    "\t\t- occurs during program execution and leads to a abnormal/unexpected termination of the program. An example would be dividing a number by zero -  it would cause the execution of the program to halt/quit. The best programs are \"robust\" in that they avoid as many run-time errors as possible.\n",
    "\t\t- Typically these errors are caused by execptions and can be dealt with appropriately with \"try and except\" blocks of code for robustness\n",
    "\t- logical error:\n",
    "\t\t- occurs when the error is not brought up by the compiler or during execution, it is realized through faulty results. They are typically the hardest to find as the source of the problem could lie anywhere in the program or what is fed into the program. An example would be a faulty calculation statement.\n",
    "### Object Oriented Programming (Ch 1.6)\n",
    "- Problem Solving\n",
    "\t- Object orientent language helps us problem solve\n",
    "\t- Basic (non-linear) steps of problem solving:\n",
    "\t\t1- understanding the problem\n",
    "\t\t2- designing a solution\n",
    "\t\t3- considering alternatives to the solution and refining that solution\n",
    "\t\t4- Implementing the solution (should intertwine tesing)\n",
    "\t\t5- Testing the solution and fixing any problems that exist\n",
    "\t- the key to designing a problem solution is breaking it down into manageable pieces\n",
    "\t\t- Specifically in programming, we design separate pieces that are responsible for certain parts of the solution, and then integrate them with the other parts.\n",
    "- Object Oriented Software Principles\n",
    "\t- Object:\n",
    "\t\t- an object is a fundamental element in a program. It often represents a real object within the \"problem-domain\" (such as a bank account at a bank). Every object has a \"state\" and a set of \"behaviors\"(functions or methods available to the object).\n",
    "\t\t\t- the state of being of the object is its fundamental characteristics that currently define the object\n",
    "\t\t- apart from objects in OOP there are pieces of \"primitive data\" which maybe a number or string and called this as they less complex entities than an \"object\"\n",
    "\t\t- defined by a class-> is an instance of a class\n",
    "\t\t- One **KEY PRINCIPLE** of programming and management of objects is that: \n",
    "\t\t\t- **a object should be encapsulated, meaning it protects and manages its own information, its self governing. The only changes being made to the state of the object should be accomplished by that object's methods. programs should be designed so that other objects cannot alter the state of one another**\n",
    "\t- Attribute:\n",
    "\t\t- an Objects attributes are the values it stores internally, which may be reperesented as \"primitive data\" or as other objects. ex. an object attribute for the bank account might be a floating point number (a primitive value) that represents the balance of the account or a string representing the name of the account owner\n",
    "\t\t- collectively the attributes of an object define its current \"state\"\n",
    "\t- Method:\n",
    "\t\t- a group of programming statements given a name. When a method is invoked, its statements are executed.\n",
    "\t\t- A set of methods is associated with an object- these methods of an object define its potential behaviors/actions\n",
    "\t- Class:\n",
    "\t\t- a class is the model or \"blueprint\" from which an object is created. It establishes the kind of data an object of that type will hold and defines the methods that represent the behavior/abilities of such objects.\n",
    "\t- Inheritance:\n",
    "\t\t- the concept of classes being created from other classes. the definition of one class can be based on another class that already exists. Inheritance is a form of software reuse which capitalizes on the simularities between various kinds of classes that we may want to create. This allows for a heirarchy of classes where high-level classes have very generic methods and attributes that can be inherited by the classes that are lower-level and derived from a high-level class and these lower level classes may inherit the generic but will also have more specialized methods or attributes. \n",
    "\t\t\t- an example would be at a bank you could have a class named \"account\" which could derive the class \"bank account\" that could go on to derive classes \"Savings account\" and \"checking account\"\n",
    "\t- Polymorphism:\n",
    "\t\t- the idea that we can refer to multiple types of related objects over time in consistent ways- which gives us the ability to design powerful and elegant solutions to problems that deal with multiple objects.\n",
    "\t\t\t- Like freezing all accounts(savings/checking) related to a main account.\n",
    "## CHAPTER 2: Data and Expressions\n",
    "### Character Strings (Ch 2.1)\n",
    "- print and println methods\n",
    "\t- when executing a println statement in java through: \"System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\" - the System.out represents an object \"out\" from the class \"System\" where \"out\" represents an output device or file which is typically your monitor. Specifically the println() method is a service that System.out object performs for us.\n",
    "\t\t- Each time we call this method from the object we input a string that is a \"Parameter\" for the method telling it what we want to print.\n",
    "\t- \"print\" is printing a string with no newline character at the end where as \"println\" will automatically move the printing process to a newline when completed.\n",
    "- Concatenation\n",
    "\t\t- the act of adding one string to another with \"+\" - used when a string is too big to fit onto one line\n",
    "- Escape Sequences\n",
    "\t- used to print special characters such as a \\\" and other processes like printing a tab or newline (\\t or \\n)\n",
    "\t- begins with a backslash character \"\\\"\n",
    "### Variables and Assignment (Ch 2.2)\n",
    "- Variables\n",
    "\t- is the name for a location in memory used to hold a data value. A variable declaration instructs the compiler to reserve a portion of main memory space large enough to hold a particular type of value and indicates the name by which we will refer to that memory location.\n",
    "- Assignment statement\n",
    "\t- assigns a value to a variable\n",
    "- NOTE: Java language is strongly typed as in that we are not allowed to assign a value to a variable that is inconsistent with its declared type.\n",
    "- Constants\n",
    "\t- a type of a identify similar to variable but different in that once they are declared they hold that value for all of their existence. This is done by preceding an identifier with \"final\"\n",
    "### Primitive Data Types (Ch 2.3) (there are 8 prititive data types in java)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integers and floating points\n",
    "\t- Integers are whole numbers. There are four integer data types: byte, short, int, and long\n",
    "\t- floating point numbers have fractional parts. There are two floating point data types: float and double \n",
    "\t- All of the numeric data types differ by the amount of memory space used to store a value of that type, which determines the range of values that can be repesented for each type.\n",
    "\t- All numeric data types are \"signed\" which means they can be expressed as positive or negative.\n",
    "- Characters\n",
    "\t- a fundamental data type that can be represented as individual data items or can be combined to form character strings. Numbers in a string are refered to as characters.\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "\t- a data type that can have two values either \"true\" or \"false\". Used typically to indicate whether a certain condition is true\n",
    "### Expressions (Ch 2.4)\n",
    "- Expression\n",
    "\t- A combination of one or more operators and operands that usually perform a calculation\n",
    "- Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\t- available for all int and float data types and include the following: +, -, /, *, %\n",
    "- Operator precedence\n",
    "\t- Is the order in which operators execute: (*,/,%) all have equal precedence (left to right) and then following that (+,-) which have equal precedence\n",
    "\t- Can always be controlled through use of parentheses\n",
    "- Increment and decrement operators\n",
    "\t- Incrementing by 1 goes as follows: count++;\n",
    "\t- Decrementing by 1 goes as follows: count--;\n",
    "- Assignment operators\n",
    "\t- used to alter the values assigned to varaible such as: count +=5 would take what ever count is defined as and add 5\n",
    "\t- can be done with other operators: -=, /=, *=, %=\n",
    "### Interactive Programs (Ch 2.6)\n",
    "- Scanner\n",
    "\t- provides convinient methods for reading input values of various types\n",
    "\t- must create a scanner object in the program to use its methods: \"Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\"\n",
    "\t\t- In this line the object itself is created by the \"new\" operator and a call to a special method called a constructor is made to set up the object. This Scanner constructor accepts a parameter that indicates the source of the input. System.in object reperesents the standard input stream which is usually just your keyboard\n",
    "### The Math Class (Ch 3.5)\n",
    "- Provides a large number of basic mathematical functions that are helpful with calculations \n",
    "- All the methods in the Math class are static methods(class methods) which means that they can be invoked through the name of the class in which they are defined, without having to instantiate an object of the class first\n",
    "- examples include Math.abs(total) & Math.pow(count, 2)\n",
    "## Week 2 â€“ Introduction to Using Classes\n",
    "### Data Conversion (Ch 2.5)\n",
    " - Conversion techniques (3 ways)\n",
    "\t- Assignment Conversion:\n",
    "\t\t- occurs when a value of one type is assigned to a variable of another type during which the value is converted to that new type. This can only be done in a widening conversion( taking more memory spaces more bytes).\n",
    "\t\t\t- Example: money is a float variable and dollars is an int variable when you do the following:\n",
    "\t\t\t\t- \"money = dollars;\" - then the value of dollars is instantly converted to a float type.\n",
    "\t- Promotion conversion: \n",
    "\t\t- occurs automatically when certain operators need to modify their operands in order to perform the operation.\n",
    "\t\t\t- Example: if sum is a floating point is divided by an integer called count -> then count is \"promoted\" to a float automatically before the operation takes place\n",
    "\t- Casting \n",
    "\t\t- most general form of conversion in java, a cast is a java operator that is specified by a type name in parentheses and is placed infront of the value you wish to convert\n",
    "\t\t\t- Example: dollars = (int)money  - in this case money is temporarily changed to type int for the assignment but is not permenently converted to that type\n",
    "\t\t- helpful for treating value temporarily as a different type\n",
    "### Creating Objects (Ch 3.1)\n",
    "- Declaring variables\n",
    "\t- To instantiate an object we can use the \"new\" operator which returns the address of the new object\n",
    "\t\t- Example: if \"int num;\" & \"String name;\" then, we can give values to these two variables as follows: \"num = 42;\" & \"name = new String(\"James Gosling\");\n",
    "\t\t- In this example the new operator creates the object then, a constructer is invoked to help set it up initially. A constructor is a special method that has the same name as the class. In this example, the parameter to the constructor is a string literal that specifies the characters that the string object will hold.\n",
    "\t\t- Futhermore num holds the value 42 whereas, name is an \"object reference\" that holds the address of the object **THEREFORE it can be thought of as a pointer to the location in memory where the object is held**.\n",
    "\t\t- After the object has been instantiated we use the dot(.) operator to access its methods. Since this object is of class String we can do the following:\n",
    "\t\t\t- length_of_name = name.length()  -to get the length of string defined by name instantiation \n",
    "\t- HOWEVER character strings are so fundamental that java defines string literals delimited by double quotation marks - so that whenever a string literal appears => a \"String\" object is created automatically therefore we can do the following:\n",
    "\t\t- String city = \"Spokane\";\n",
    "- Aliases\n",
    "\t- Because an object reference variable stores an address, a programmer must be careful when managing objects. An Alias can occur when one object reference variable is set to another object reference variable essentially copying the reference address of the the other variable so that both variable now refer to the same object in memory. That object now has two aliases. \n",
    "\t- Since we can only use objects through reference, when an object has lost all its reference variables, possibly through reassignment, we can never access or use the attributes and methods of that object in the program ever again - it is refered to as garbage.\n",
    "### The String Class (Ch 3.2)\n",
    " - Important methods\n",
    "\t- Some important methods include: \n",
    "\t\t- equals(String str) returns: boolean => allows you to test if this string is equal to str.\n",
    "\t\t- length() retruns: Int => returns length of string\n",
    "\t\t- replace(char oldChar, char newChar) returns: String => returns same string replacing all instances of oldChar with Newchar\n",
    " - Immutable means \n",
    "\t- It cannot be changed, a String object cannot be changed but methods can return a new string object with altered values.\n",
    "### Packages (Ch 3.3)\n",
    "- Import declaration\n",
    "\t- specifies the packages and classes that will be used in a program so that the fully qualified name is not neccessary with each reference:\n",
    "\t\t* \"import java.util.Scanner;\" - makes the Scanner directly referrable as \"Scanner\" \n",
    "### The Random Class (Ch 3.4)\n",
    "- Pseudorandom meansâ€¦\n",
    "\t- sequence of numbers is one that appears to be statistically random, despite having been produced by a completely deterministic and repeatable process\n",
    "- Important methods\n",
    "\t- Random() => a constuctor that creates a new pseudorandom number generator\n",
    "\t- nextFloat() returns: float => returns a random number inbetween 0.0 and 1.0\n",
    "### Formatting Output (Ch 3.6)\n",
    "- NumberFormat class \n",
    "\t- Provides generic formating capabilities for numbers. Used by requesting an object from one of that static methods yoy invoke through the class name itself \n",
    "\t\t- Example: format(double number) => returns a string containing the specified number formatted according to this object's pattern\n",
    "\t\t- OR static NumberFormat getPercentInstance() => returns a NumberFormat object that represents a percentage format for the current locale.\n",
    "- DecimalFormat class\n",
    "\t- Instantiated in the traditional way using the \"new\" operator. Its constructor takes a string that represents the type of pattern the that will guide the formatting process => From there we can us the method to format a particular value.\n",
    "- The printf method (this is the way we will use in this course)\n",
    "\t- allows the user to print a formated string containing data values. The first parameter takes in the string with symboling placeholders for variables and the next parameters specify those variables to be filled in in-order.\n",
    "### Enumerated Types (Ch 3.7)\n",
    "- Type-safe means\n",
    "\t- means that any attempt to use a value other than one of the enumerated values will result in a compile-time error.\n",
    "### Wrapper Classes (Ch 3.8)\n",
    "- Autoboxing\n",
    "\t- The automatic conversion between a primitive value and a corresponding wrapper object.\n",
    "\t\t- Example: \"Integer obj1;\", \"int num1 = 69;\", \"obj1 = num1;\" => an int value(69) is assigned to an integer object reference variable(obj1)\n"
