    "### Software Development Activities (Ch 7.1)\n",
    "#### A proper software design includes the following efforts(non-sequential):\n",
    "- Requirements\n",
    "\t- software requirements  specify what a program must accomplish - indicating what tasks should be performed - not how they should be performed\n",
    "\t\t- often these requirements are expressed in a document called a functional specification\n",
    "\t\t- these requirements when specified by a client might be incomplete, ambiguous, and sometimes even contradictory.\n",
    "\t- requirments define the characteristics that make the program useful to the client\n",
    "\t- requirements may also act as constraints - such as how fast a task must be performed\n",
    "- Design\n",
    "\t- software design indicates HOW a program will accomplish its requirements - the design specifies the classes and objects needed in a program and defines how they interact. It also defines relationships amoung the classes and low-level design is concerned with how methods accomplish their tasks.\n",
    "- Implementation(least creative peice)\n",
    "\t- the process of of writing the source code that will solve the problem - it is the act of translating the design into a particular programming language.\n",
    "- Testing\n",
    "\t- testing is the act of ensuring that a program will solve the intended problem given all of the constraints under which it must perform- this includes running a program multiple times with various inputs and carefully scrutinizing the results\n",
    "### Identifying Classes and Objects (Ch 7.2)\n",
    "- Finding your candidate classes\n",
    "\t- one popular way to identify your candidate classes is to think about the objects(nouns) you have in your problem description.\n",
    "\t- one key decision to conssider in this process is:\n",
    "\t\t- should it be represented as an object or as a primitive attribute of another object?\n",
    "\t\t\t- a simple integer of salary shouldn't be an object - however if there is a lot of data connected to it and methods we need to run against it - maybe it should be an object\n",
    "\t- try to strike a balance between class designations that are too generic and those that are too specific\n",
    "- Responsibilities\n",
    "\t- each class represents an object with certain behaviors that are defined by the methods of the class - these are assigned responsibilities that are part of the design of a program\n",
    "### Static Class Members (Ch 7.3)\n",
    "- Static Keyword\n",
    "\t- as static method is one that is invoked through its class name, instead of through an object of that class.\n",
    "- Static variables\n",
    "\t- a static variable also known as a class variable(opposite to instance variable) is shared amoung all instances of a class- meaning there is only one copy of a static variable shared amoung all the instaces of that class - also meaning that changing a static variable in one object changes it in all the other objects aswell \n",
    "\t- a local variable defined within a method cannot be static\n",
    "\t- constant variable denoted by the final modifier are often denoted as static given that if its never changing you might as well only use one copy of it\n",
    "- Static methods\n",
    "\t- A static method(A.K.A class method) can be invoked through the class name without needing to instantiate an object of that class (ex. math.sqrt())\n",
    "\t\t- this is why the main method is always static so the interpreter doesn't have to instatiate an object to run the method\n",
    "\t- Since static methods don't operate in the context of a particular object they can't reference any instance variables which only exist within an instance of a class. However, they can access static variable and local variables(like how main method has access to those local main method variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Relationships (Ch 7.4)\n",
    "#### The most common class relationships are dependency, aggregation, and inheritiance\n",
    "- Dependency among classes\n",
    "\t- this relationship occurs when one class depends on another such as one class needing to invoke methods of another class (\"uses\" relationship) \n",
    "\t- if a method of class B is not static then class A must have access to class B in order to invoke the method.\n",
    "\t\t- the way one class gets access to another class is an important design decision \n",
    "\t\t- can occur through one class instanitated a object of another class to use its methods but this is usually the basis for an aggregation relationship\n",
    "\t- in general we want to minimize the number of dependencies amoung classes so that changes and errors have a lower impact on the overall performance of the program.\n",
    "- Dependency in same class\n",
    "\t- a class object can be dependent on another object of that same class meaning the two interact. For instance, one method of one object may take in a parameter of that type of object. \n",
    "\t\t- ex. str3 = str1.concat(str2)\n",
    "- Aggregation\n",
    "\t- occurs from the idea that some objects are made up of other objects such as a car is made up of an engine, its frame, its wheels, its radiator, ect. In this respect we would say that the car object is an aggregation - it is composed of other objects. Aggregation is often refered to as a \"has-a\" relationship. \n",
    "\t- in software an Aggregate Object is one that contains references to other objects as instance data. \n",
    "- this keyword\n",
    "\t- \"this\" allows an object to refer to itself. This allows a method to work with a particular object and its instance variables.\n",
    "Interfaces (Ch 7.5)\n",
    "- Defining\n",
    "\t- a java interface is a collection of constants and abstract methods \n",
    "\t\t- an abstract method is a method that doesn't have an implementation - there is no body of code defined for an abstract method\n",
    "\t\t- a class implements an interface by providing method implementations for each of the abstract methods defined in the interface\n",
    "- Comparable \n",
    "\t- the carable interface contains onlly one method compareTo() which takes an object as a parameter and returns a integer- providing a common mechanism for comparing one object to another\n",
    "- Iterator\n",
    "\t- used by a class that represents a collection of objects providing a means to move through the collection one object at a time\n",
    "Enumerated Types (Ch 7.6)\n",
    "- special type of class - defines a new data type and lists all possible values of that type and that the value of the enumerated types are objects.\n",
    "\t- ex:\n",
    "\t\t- enum Season {winter, spring, summer, fall}\n",
    "- Relationship with static variables\n",
    "\t- values of enumerated types are objects - the values are in fact, instances of its own enumerated type(ex: winter is an object of the Season class) - these values are references to season objects that are stored as public static variables within the Season class.\n",
    "\t\t- ex: \n",
    "\t\t\t- time = Season.spring \n",
    "### Method Design (Ch 7.7)\n",
    "-> how does method decomposition and implications of passing objects as parameters play a part in program design?\n",
    "- Decomposition\n",
    "\t- decomposition of a method is neccessary when it becomes so complicated it cannot be written as one method any longer. So we need to split it into multiple methods for a more clean design.\n",
    "- Helper methods\n",
    "\t- helper methods are private methods within a class that are created to assist other public methods within the class.\n",
    "- Method Parameters\n",
    "\t- In java all method parameters are passed by value meaing that the original value of the parameter used to invoke is copied into the formal parameter in the method header. Since it is simply a copied value- altering the formal parameter doesn't impact the actual parameter.\n",
    "\t- HOWEVER if you pass in an object as an actual parameter to a method we are actually passing in a reference to that object - meaning the value that gets copied into the formal parameter is the address of that object in memory-> therefore the actual and formal parameters become aliases of one another. Therefore if we alter the formal parameter we alter the actual parameter outside the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overloading (Ch 7.8)\n",
    "-> Using the same method name with different parameter lists for multiple methods\n",
    "- Why?\n",
    "\t- helpful for situations where you need to perform similar methods on different kinds of data.\n",
    "- How\n",
    "\t- in java the method name for two or more methods can be the same as long as the additional information like no. of parameters, type of those parameters or the order of the types of parameters can be used to distictly identify which version of method the program is making a reference to\n",
    "### Testing (Ch 7.9)\n",
    "-> running the program with various inputs and measuring outputs or impacts to measure if your program is executing as intended.\n",
    "- Reviews\n",
    "\t- technique used to evaluate design or code that involves multiple people examining a design document or a section of code. Presenting our design/code forces us to thing more carefully about it and opens the design up for questioning and suggestions\n",
    "\t- should measure whether the requirements have been met and if the design has been followed in the inplementation\n",
    "- Defect Testing\n",
    "\t- form of testing focused on finding and eliminating errors since they typically almost certainly exist in new code. We do this through testing - a good test is one that uncovers any deficiencies in a program.\n",
    "\t\t- test case => consists of a set of inputs, user actions, or other initial conditions, along with the expected output. these should be well documented for futher use\n",
    "\t\t- test suite =>  a set of test cases that covers various aspects of a system\n",
    "- Black Box \n",
    "\t- treats the program aspect being tested as a black box - in this form of testing, test cases are developed without regard to internal workings- black box testing is based simply on inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\t- the input data for a blackbox testing are often selected by defining equivalence categories\n",
    "\t\t- equivalence categories: (- which is a collection of inputs that are expected to produce similar outputs). Generally if a method will work for one value in the equivalence category it should work for the others in that category.\n",
    "\t\t\t- equivalence categories have defined boundaries - meaning that the boundaries are sought out and tested exhaustively to define what works and what doesn't for a method or program.\n",
    "- White Box(glass-box testing)\n",
    "\t- excersizes the internal structure and implementation of a method\n",
    "\t- based on the logic of the code\n",
    "\t- goal is to ensure that every path through a program is executed at least once. So test cases for white box testing are designed to test/execute all possible paths through a program to get whats called \"statement coverage\"\n",
    "- should determine the expected outputs of the program before running a test case.\n"
