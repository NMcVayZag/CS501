    "### Creating Subclasses (Ch 9.1)\n",
    "- Deriving means …\n",
    "    - creating a subclass(childclass) \"derived\" from a parent(base or super) class - meaning that it retains some core aspects of the core class(inheritance) but has some particular changes.\n",
    "        - all methods and variables of a parent class are accessible by the child class except for constructors which wouldn't be neccessary.  \n",
    "    - creating classes from inheritance is faster, cheaper, and easier than creating them from scratch\n",
    "    - \"class\" comes from idea classifying groups of similar objects - so it makes sense that classes often relate to one another.\n",
    "    - java uses the word \"extends\" to indicate that a new class is being derived from an existing class.\n",
    "- Reuse benefits\n",
    "    - using existing software components to create new ones you can capitalize on the effort that went into the design, implementation, and testing of existing software.\n",
    "- Is-a relationship\n",
    "    - a \"is-a\" relationship is established through inhertitance meaning if a child class dog was derived from the parent class mammal then it \"is-a\" mammal. It is just a more specific class of mammal.\n",
    "- The protected visibility modifier(# in UML)\n",
    "    - allows for a inbetween of public and private modifiers. If a variable or method are declared protected then they may be accessed by any class in the same package, in addition to being accessable by any derived classes.\n",
    "- The super reference\n",
    "    - the reserved word \"super\" can be used by a child class to reference its parent class. - through this we can access a parent's members such as constructors. Any change made to the parent class within using super will automatically be reflected within the child class.\n",
    "    - similar to \"this.\" functionality what the word \"super\" refers to depends on the class in which it is used.\n",
    "    - a child's constructor is respsonsible for calling its parent's constructor - using super to call a parent's constructor is only permitted inside the childs constructor and must be the first line inside.\n",
    "- Multiple inheritance\n",
    "    - not supported by Java but is supported by other programming languages- allows a child class to have multiple parent classes - often used in situations where you want to describe objects that are in the middle of two different categories or objects.\n",
    "### Overriding Methods (Ch 9.2)\n",
    "- The override happens in the …\n",
    "    - override happens in the child class where the class defines a method with the exact same signature as a method in the parent class - the childs version overrides the parents version of the method\n",
    "    - One caveat to this is that a parent class can include a \"final\" modifier that blocks this kind of override in the child from occcuring- making sure the parent's method is always used.\n",
    "- Shadowing variables\n",
    "    - shadowing variables is declaring a variable in a child class(the shadow vairable) that has the same name as one in inherited from the parent class\n",
    "    - possible but NOT RECOMMENDED- causes confusion and serves no purpose.\n",
    "### Class Hierarchies (Ch 9.3)\n",
    "- Parents and ancestors\n",
    "    - two children classes of the same parent are called simblings - even though they share some inherited content they themselves are not related via inheritance since one isn't used to derive the other.\n",
    "    - in class hierarchies, common features should be kept as high in the hierarchy as reasonably possible to maximize potential to re-use of classes, optimize maintnence overhead, and to make sure that differences in the child truly define the child class\n",
    "- The Object class\n",
    "    - All classes in Java are ultimately derived from the Object Class- meaning that if a class is not a child class of a parent then it is a child of the Object class\n",
    "    - because all classes are derived from Object, all public methods of Object are inherited by every java class - meaning they can be invoked through any object created in any java program - one example of this is the inherited toString() method\n",
    "- Abstract classes\n",
    "    - represents a generic concept in a class hierarchy - an abstract class cannot be instantiated and usually contains one or more abstract methods which have no finished definition(half-baked).\n",
    "    - they server as placeholders in a class hierarchy(higher up) - they represent a abstract entity that is insufficiently defined to be useful by itself - it represents a concept on which other classes can build on their definitions. They supply halfish-written definition formats that can be fully defined by those that inherit them who need to define a more specific version.\n",
    "    - a class derived from a abstract class must override all of it's parents abstract methods or the derived class will also be considered abstract.\n",
    "- Interface hierarchies\n",
    "    - one interface can be derived from another interface - a child inherits all abstract methods and constants of the parent -> any class that implements the child interface must implement all of the methods of (parent/child) interface.\n",
    "### Visibility (Ch 9.4)\n",
    "- Private members affect child classes …..\n",
    "    - a child class may inherit private members of the parent class that cannot be directly referenced by name but can be indirectly referenced via a method.\n",
    "### Designing for Inheritance (Ch 9.5)\n",
    "- Why?\n",
    "    - can lead to a more elegant/efficient design that will pay dividends in the long run. Allows for more software reuse allowing for parent classes and parent interfaces to lay the groundwork of a program. Allowing for functionality and cleanliness amoung classes while maintaining encapsulation as neccessary.\n",
    "- Restricting Inheritance \n",
    "    - final as it is used to protect methods from override - can also be used to restrict inheritance - if a class is defined with the \"final\" modifier it cannot be inherited.\n",
    "### Late Binding (Ch 10.1)\n",
    "- Polymorphism means …\n",
    "    - having many forms - a polymorphic reference is a reference variable that can refer to many different types of objects at different points in time  - for example the specific method invoked by a polymorphic reference can change from one invocation to the next.\n",
    "    - at some point a commitment is made to execute certain code to carry out a method invocation - this is referred to as binding a method invovation to a method definition. Often binding occurs at compile-time - however for polymorphic references this binding decision cannot be made until run-time.\n",
    "- Late binding means..\n",
    "    - the method definition that is used is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable at that moment - if at runtime -this deferred commitment is called late binding or dynamic binding\n",
    "        - ex. referennce variable animal might refer to a object of class dog at one point and a class fish at another point => when calling the method move() for the ref variable it refer's class specific version of the method \"move()\"\n",
    "        - it is less efficient than binding at compile time, because the decision must be made during the execution of the program. - this is overhead is ususally accepted given the flexibility that polymorphism provides.\n",
    "### Polymorphism via Inheritance (Ch 10.2)\n",
    "- when we declare a reference varible using a particular class name, it can be used to refer to any object of that class - in addition it can also refer to any any object of any class that is related to its declared type by inheritance\n",
    "    - Mammal pet;\n",
    "    Horse secretariat = new Horse()\n",
    "    pet = secretariat; //valid assignment.\n",
    "- Reference variables and inheritance\n",
    "    - the reference variable creature can be polymorphic, because at any point in time it can refer to an animal object, a mammal object, or a horse object - suppose that all these classes have a method called move that is implemented in different ways =>the following invocation will call that move method, but the particular version of the method it calls is determined at runtime:\n",
    "        - ex: creature.move()\n",
    "        - when this line is executed, if creature currently refers to a an Animal object ther move methood of the Animal class is invoked.\n",
    "- Object type at runtime determines …\n",
    "    - (not the type of the reference) which version of a particular method to invoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism via Interfaces (Ch 10.3)\n",
    "- just as a class name can be used to declare the type of an object reference variable - an interface name can be used as the type of a reference variable as well - and interface reference variable can be used to refer to any object of any class that implements that interface\n",
    "    - ex: public interface Speaker{\n",
    "        puiblic void speak();\n",
    "        public void announce(String str);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    - the interface name \"Speaker\" can now be used to declare an object reference variable:\n",
    "    - ex: Speaker current;\n",
    "    - where the refernce variable \"current\" can be used to refer to any object of any class that implements the Speaker interface- for example if we create a class \"philosopher\" that implements the interface we can assign a philosopher object to a Speaker reference:\n",
    "    - ex: current = new Philosopher()\n",
    "    - this is valid given that Philosopher is a Speaker. this relationship between class and interface forms a \"is-a\" relationship which forms the basis of the polymorphism.\n",
    "- How interface references can be used in polymorphism\n",
    "    - if we create a class called dog that also implements the Speaker interface - it can be assigned to a Speaker refernce variable as well- the reference variable can actually point to a philosopher object and later refer to a Dog object:\n",
    "    - ex: Speaker guest;\n",
    "          guest =  new Philosopher();\n",
    "          guest.speak(); // invokes philosopher speak version\n",
    "          guest = new dog();\n",
    "          guest.speak(); // invokes dog speak version\n",
    "    - as with polymorhpic references via inheritance, it is not the type of the reference that determines which method gets invoked; it is based on the type of the object that the reference points to at the moment of invocation.\n",
    "    - IMPORTANT NOTE: when we are using an interface reference variable we can only invoke the methods defined in the interface, even if the object it refers to has other also defined public methods to which it can respond:\n",
    "        - ex: Speaker special = new Philosopher()\n",
    "        -     special.pontificate() //causes a compiler error.\n",
    "        - this occurs given that the program is not sure that Speaker is a Philosopher (it could be a dog) so in order to do this we need to 1- make sure its a philosopher 2- cast the philosopher class\n",
    "        - ex: ((Philosopher)special).pontificate(); //valid\n",
    "- using a polymorphic refernce as the formal parameter in a method is a powerful technique - allowing a method to control types of parameters passed and it, yet gives it the flexibility to accept arguments of various types - for instance a method takes in a Speaker then it could be taking in a Philosopher or a dog depending on that reference variable at method invocation."
