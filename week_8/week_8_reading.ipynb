    "### Sorting (Ch 10.4)\n",
    "- sorting is the process of arranging a list of items in a well defined order\n",
    "- Selection Sort\n",
    "    - the selection sort algorithm sorts a list of values by successively putting particular values in their final sorted positions\n",
    "    - the general strategy of the selection sort is: Scan the entire list to find the smallest value- exchange that value with the value in the first position of the list. Scan the rest of the list(all but first value) to find the smallest value and then exhange it with the value at the second postion of the list. Keep doing this process until all you have left to scan is the final, largest value.\n",
    "    - this is done through two loops and through using a temporary variable for \"swapping\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insertion Sort\n",
    "    - another method in the sorting class: the insertion sort algorithm sorts a list of values by repetitevily inserting a particular value into a subset of the list that has already been sorted - one at a time each unsorted element is is inserted at the appropriate position in that sorrted subset until the entire list is in order.\n",
    "    - general strategy is: begin with a \"sorted\" list containing only one value -> sort the first two values in the list relative to each other by exhanging them if neccessary-> Insert the list's third value into the appropriote position relative to the first two (sorted) values -> repeat process until the list is completely sorted.\n",
    "- Comparing Sorts\n",
    "    - one algorithm might be better for a situation than another - they differ in simplicity, level of efficiency, and the amount of energy used\n",
    "    - if a algoritm is very simple then it is readable and very easy to debug however, the most simple algorithms are often the most inefficient.\\\n",
    "    - In most cases efficiency of an algorithm is the most important factor- a algorithm is said to be more efficient than another if it makes less comparisions than the other.\n",
    "    - the two algorithms above have the same level of efficiency given the fact that they both require two loops to iterate/sort over a list => they both perform at n^2(\"order n^2\") number of comparisions where n is the amount of values in the list. more efficient sorts are of a smaller order, such as n log(base2) n.\n",
    "### Searching (Ch 10.5)\n",
    "- searching is the process of finding a designated target element within a group of items. The search pool is the array of items we will be searching through\n",
    "- Linear search\n",
    "    - a linear search is conducted by beginning at the start of the list and going through each element assesing for a match and if the end of the list is reached without a match then it doesn't exist in the list\n",
    "- Binary search\n",
    "    - viable option if the list is sorted in ascending or descending order => more efficient than the linear search\n",
    "    - A binary search eliminates large parts of the search pool with each comparision by capitalizing on the fact that the search pool is ordered. \n",
    "    - unlike the linear search the binary search begins in the middle of a sorted list - suppose we are looking for the value 60 in a sorted list and we begin on middle element 40 -> then we can rule out the entire left side of the list as non-viable candidates for a match => this ramps up efficiency by taking half the data out of consideration. => from that point on we take the middle index from the remaining list of viable candadites(middle index of second half of the list) and makes a comparison then repeats the process until min range boundary is greater than max range boundary.\n",
    "- Comparing searches\n",
    "    - given the situation a binary search might be more ideal if the list is maintained in a sorted manner - however if the list is not often searched and is unordered than one could use a linear search.\n",
    "### Designing for Polymorphism (Ch 10.6)\n",
    "- polymorphism provides a means to create elegant versatility in our software. It allows us to apply a consistent approach to inconsistent but related behaviors. We should be looking for opportunites to utilize polymorphism in our problem solutions - where different types of objects perform the same type of behavior their is a opportunity for a polymorphic solution.\n",
    "- How do you choose between inheritance and interfaces?\n",
    "    - it all depends on the relationships between your objects. If your objects can be related naturally by inheritance where there is a \"is-a\" relationship between objects then polymorphism through inheritance is the right choice however if your objects relate to on another in the way they need to be processed than polymorphism through interfaces is the way to go.\n",
    "### Exception Handling (Ch 11.1)\n",
    "- An exception is ...\n",
    "    - an exception is an object that defines an unusual or erroneous situation. An exception is thrown by a program or the run-time environemnt and can be caught and handled appropriately if desired to stop the program from crashing.\n",
    "- An error is …\n",
    "    - an error is similar to an expection except that an error generally represents an unrecoverable situation and should not be caught\n",
    "### Uncaught Exceptions (Ch 11.2)\n",
    "- What happens?\n",
    "    - if an exception is not caught and is not handled the program will terminate abnormally and produce a message that describes the exception that occured and where it occcured\n",
    "### The try-catch Statement (Ch 11.3)\n",
    "- the try-catch stament identifies a segment of code that may cause an exception so it provides a way to handle them\n",
    "- The try block …\n",
    "    - the try block is the code you are attempting to excecute with no exception-  if the code executes successfully with no exceptions then the rest of the program is executed as usual.\n",
    "- The catch clause …\n",
    "    - defines how a partricular kind of exception will be handled- each catch clause is called an exception handler. After the code in the exception catch block executes then the rest of the program continues.\n",
    "- The finally clause …\n",
    "    - defines a section of code that is executed no matted how the try block is exited. Most often a finally clause is used to manage resources or to guarentee that particular parts of an algorithm are executed.\n",
    "### Exception Propagation (Ch 11.4)\n",
    "- Describe what happens:\n",
    "    - if an exception is not caught and handled where it occurs, control is immediately returned to the method that invoked the method that produced the exception - we can configure our program to handle the execption at this outer level - if not caught there the control returns to the method that called it. this is called exeption propagation and will continue until the exception is caught and handled or until it is eventualyy passed out of the main method which will terminate the program and produce the execptions message.\n",
    "### The Exception Class Hierarchy (Ch 11.5)\n",
    "- the classes that define various exceptions are related by inheritance, creating a class hierarchy.\n",
    "- Role of the Exception class\n",
    "    - the role of the exception class is by default it acts as a parent class to many more specific \"exception\" classes. Additionally, it can be used to define our own exception from Exception or one of its descendant classes\n",
    "-  throw\n",
    "    - a throw statement is used to begin the exception propagation\n",
    "- Checked and Unchecked Exceptions\n",
    "    - checked\n",
    "        - a checked exception must either be caught by a method or it must be listed in the throws clause of any method that may throw or propagate it.\n",
    "            - a throws clause is appended to the header of a method definition to formally acknowledge that the method will throw or propagate a particular exception should it occur.\n",
    "    - unchecked\n",
    "        - the only unchecked exceptions in java are objects of RuntimeException or any of its descendants - all other execptions are considered \"checked\".\n",
    "### I/O Exceptions (Ch 11.6)\n",
    "- A stream is …\n",
    "    - a stream is an ordered sequence of bytes - it can be used as a source of input or a destination for output. Going off that there are input streams that we read from and output streams that we write to.\n",
    "- the three most relavent streams are the standard I/O streams known as System.in(standardIn), System.out(standard out), System.err(standard error stream) \n",
    "- many operations performed by I/O can potentially throw an IOException which is the parent of several exceptions classes that represent problems when trying to I/O. \n",
    "    - ex. trying to read from a file path that doesn't exist.\n"
